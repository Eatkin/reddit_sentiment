      "Senate Banking Committee chair Sherrod Brown (D-OH) believes the votes are finally there, calling SAFE's passage \"imminent.\" When SAFE gets out of the Senate Banking Committee, the sector will pump (95% of bills die in committee, do not make it to Senate floor). When SAFE passes the Senate and gets signed into law, it will fly. When the DEA announces its intent to reschedule, the sector will pump again. After the 30-60 day comment period is over (Administrative Procedures Act requires) and rescheduling is implemented it will explode. Over a longer term, companies in the sector will uplist to better exchanges, see strong growth due to the removal of IRS 280E (prohibits business tax deductions), see substantial capital inflow from inclusion in ETFs, and report strong earning and positive EBITDAs. We are looking at a rally that should sustain itself throughout the 2024 election season, 12-18 months perhaps.\n",

      "Here's some advice from someone in their 50's.  Never YOLO unless you'd bet the same amount at a casino and could live with the outcome. I play in options but never buy them.  I only sell.  I buy stocks I would be comfortable keeping long term, and then sell short term options for an amount I'd be comfortable with.  I will never make huge gains with this, but do make a decent amount most months. In essence, I'm only betting my **potential upside**. If I'm wrong, I make less but don't lose anything.

      "This is because the big 3 automakers have an insane exposure to the value of their own cars on their balance sheets through debt secured by lease obligations. The strike will shut down production ensuring that they can wind down supply and keep prices high, thus keeping them from having to recognize heavy losses as we go into recession. Then at the same time they save on labor costs. Win win.\n",

      "Why wouldn't it be bullish.  In the last three years almost every plant has been down 30% of the time because of supply issues.  Even when not laid off production was down significantly because of parts issues, yet all are claiming billions in profits the last 3 years ( the most in history).  Is everything a scam.  These profit numbers, Hunter Biden's art selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars, pro athletes and college coaches that no one ever heard of making tens of millions of dollars a year with 10 year deals.  Is absolutely everything today a scam, bribery, and money laundering?  It couldn't be possible that accounting firms like Pricewaterhouse are fudging numbers.  No way...I guess your gonna tell me next that Moody's, and Standard and Poors gave  AAA ratings to subprime mortgage backed securities in 2007. C'mon man....\n",
