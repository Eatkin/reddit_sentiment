The longer this bubble lasts, the higher off the ground that bottom rung of the latter will go. More and more people will be priced out of a financially secure/comfortable future. 

So hey, if you were over leveraged and got your ass destroyed, I'm sorry for you. But if you want a more balanced distribution of wealth, where you can actually retire with enough to live comfortably and afford health care...well, I'm personally praying for blood in the streets.",47,top,"Daily Discussion Thread for September 21, 2023",1,1.908880352973938,0.0,0.0,1.209405541419983

819,"the surprise is Powell was asked directly is soft landing the Fed's base case, and he said no. He then said that soft landing is not up to the Fed. In several previous FOMC, he specifically said recession is not his base case, which implies soft landing is. Now he's saying soft landing isn't either.

By the way, soft landing or not wasn't ever going to be up to the Fed. Soft landing largely depends on will there be any shock, even if trivial in a normal economy, that happen in the long timeframe between now and late 2024, early 2025. When the Fed is restricting the economy, it's fragile and prone to tip over due to any trivial shock. So even if it looks like a soft landing now, it needs to continue being that way for 1-2 more years.

The fed had never been in this predicament. Either decision will ruin lives. Keep raising interest rates to destroy their rich buddies lives, banks, businesses, institutions etc. which will trickle down and hurt everyone in the process.

Mortgage default? Commercial real estate default?

1043,"Fairly accurate. I would say though the Fed is typically wrong about when they will do rate cuts. Dont be surprised if they hold rates for several quarters, but the first rate cut of 2024 will be a massive cut AFTER they break something critical.

The biggest issue still looming is the commercial real estate crisis and the impact it will have on banks. That issue will break several banks and it will force the Fed to decide to either cut rates to save the banking system OR accept that a bunch of banks are going to fail and the economy will have a major recession while that gets sorted back out. Business cant function without adequate banking security. 

The issue with commercial real estate is that the cash flow on these buildings doesnt work for the borrower at the new rates. They turn back in the keys. The banks now have to value the building at current market value immediately and write down their assets as a result. That write down impacts their capital reserves on paper and bank unrecognized losses become recognized in part. Banks can absorb a few of these hits, but the issue is that the amount coming down the pipe means that the crisis could literally burst between fomc meetings in a manner that has to be addressed rapidly. Fed will have to reverse course on QT and enter into QE. Then at the next meeting rates will drop. 

Now the banks can avoid some of this if they are willing to roll the lending over at terms that work for the borrower, but that isnt something the bank wants to do because they can only do that so much before that also becomes a major issue for them. Basically imagine they take a minor loss on the loan to avoid taking a major loss on the loan. Banks dont want to take any loss and are highly reticent to do it, but they might do that for awhile to buy time until a rate cut comes down from on high. I know this because I worked for banks and literally listened so a conversation about something like this in 2007. The bank literally had a situation where the ltv for a building was outside the parameters they normally approved, but it was either they worked out a deal or they would be handed the building. The deal took several months to hash out because the initial offers the bank made didnt work for the borrower. Basically the issue can be seen as the two parties recognize there is a loss of a few million dollars that is going to happen. How do they split that loss up. Neither side wants to take the loss entirely. The borrower says hey Im willing to split it with you if you give me a rate below your borrowing cost. Bank was like no way in hell am I doing that. Borrower says fine then take the building. Bank back room guys say whoa that will be a major loss of several million dollars to the bank. They tell the lending guy that he should go back to the borrower and see if they can work out a deal. End of the day the borrower and the bank worked out a deal. I dont know the exact terms, but I do know that the bank wasn't making any money on the deal and I suspect they were taking a loss that was spread out over several years. Full disclosure that bank doesnt exist anymore it was bought out after the GFC. I no longer work in banking.",175,top,For the regards who don't know what the hell just happened,3,0.24111193418502808,0.0,0.7648594975471497,1.256411075592041

If all of these strikes result in raises - which they are bound to, even if not as much as they are asking…then how do we expect to “beat” inflation when everyone is earning more… 🤔

I had that reaction at the end of the Jackson Hole conference when I bought puts and had to watch my position go red for a few minutes of market capitulation before finally dumping and my puts going well into the green.

I had my finger on the button to send a buy order for expiring SPX 4455p today when they were in the mid 11 range... As soon as the rates were published with y1 and y2 .5% above projected I expected a downward move, yet immediately saw an uptick in SPX, which put me in *WTF!?* mode for all of 2 seconds, long enough for the puts to move past my limit order. Watched SPX dump, pump back up to 4454, then dive again during JPow's press conference and Q&A. Sure, -0.94% isn't a hugely red day, but... how did they not see this shit coming? They've kept shit pretty damn consistent, especially right on with what was said post Jackson Hole, and... eh, fuck it. I'm just salty I told my job I wasn't coming in until market closure, and, in complete contradiction to my usually objective and detached trading approach, I apparently psyched myself out, hesitated, and never made the trade.

1325,"I’m struggling to grasp the details of this article, which states, “Cisco is set to acquire cybersecurity firm Splunk for $157 per share in an all-cash transaction.” If that’s the case, shouldn’t Splunk’s stock be valued at $157 presently? Yet, as of 11:30 EST today, Splunk’s trading price is approximately $144. Is this discrepancy due to:

	•	The announcement being preliminary and subject to changes even though approved by both boards?
	•	Potential interventions from external authorities, such as government agencies, that might prevent the deal?
	•	The expected completion of the acquisition being slated for a year from now?

I’ve generally observed that stocks match the acquisition offer shortly after such announcements. Could someone provide a more in-depth explanation?",1,top,Cisco buying cybersecurity company Splunk for $28 Billion,1,0.5004716515541077,0.0,0.7623551487922668,0.4453909397125244

1735,"Dollar General is going to add a ton more stores over the next couple years. Like 50% more. Now, they might sound bullish, however they are already having internal problems. 

Staffing shortages, out of stock merch, lower cost options available elsewhere. The first aid aisles at most of the stores around me (rural area in a normally VHCOL state) are bone dry. They have pricier retail items with nominally lower margins without any source of security. 

However, they do have a chance. If they grow their location count, taking advantage of a commercial real estate pop during a discretionary recession, they could instantly solidify their portfolio. But, it will take realizing some failures. 

You can’t curate your own branded items like a Kroger when you can’t keep merch in your store before payment. You can’t staff a store with single person coverage. You can’t exist in a “nobody wants to work” narrative when you don’t offer a job that at least can feed the employee. You have to do better than Walmart. 

So, you invest in your current good stores, end leases on non competitive stores, and you ensure that when you invest in a new store that it exists in the right place. Keep your people happier than Walmart, charge customers a deep low margin price and keep stock of things that sell. And get rid of the junk that doesn’t.

I was recently stopping in to grocery store in rural America and I forgot they buy a months worth of shit at a time. It took me like a half hour to check out behind Costco sized purchases in a town that just has 2 normal grocery stores. The round trip is like $50 in gas and 2 hours round trip.

He is genuinely the Bernie Madoff of our time.

Edit: I want to point out that u/effUtube just asked “where is the fraud” and then deleted his comment 😂
