Honestly, delving deep into the world of options trading was a transformative journey for me. Some people find enlightenment atop a mountain; I found mine watching my portfolio take a nosedive. It‚Äôs not about the money lost, but the invaluable life lessons acquired. In this profound odyssey, I‚Äôve come to appreciate the delicate dance between risk and reward, ambition and humility. Embracing the ebb and flow of the financial world has been my Everest.

That's a totally normal condition.  It should cost more to rent than to own.  Owning requires a significant capital investment+leverage, risk, liability, maintenance, taxes, insurance etc, etc.

2023 and still not a single case where bitcoin is unitarily better at doing anything besides being a high vol. bag that one sucker can pass off to the next sucker (hopefully at a higher price). At least with Monero I can understand the combination being fungible, fast, locked to the USD, and offers enough anonymity to allow criminals and tax cheats to favor it, but BTC isn't digital gold since it high vol, isn't an alternative/replacement to the dollar since folks don't use it so much as speculate on it, and isn't really an innovation play if it correlates with the QQQ more than gold because there's nothing behind it unlike the tech companies of the QQQ.

Republicans will say they don't want that and lets face it since maybe 2016 maybe even as far back as 2008 the Repub's will simply push back because it's what the Dems want.

It probably doesn't even make it as far as a congressional vote, but if it does there is basically a 90% chance it fails. If by some miracle it makes it as far as the senate then you've got a decent shot of it becoming law... as long as the Dems win the 24 election that is because it's not getting a senate vote before that day.

Second to final note - Biden isn't going to run on this. He's a conservative Dem who despite everything will be in a very tough race. He isn't going to make an issue which is probably ranked 20th in order of importance with voters a central issue to his campagin.

1948,"This post is so full of 2010 era ignorance I hardly even know where to begin.

Polls in the last 3 years have repeatedly shown Republican voters are changing their minds about cannabis and now a solid majority want it legalized, with those in favor of full legalization being roughly 68% for ""conservative"" voters likely to vote in the 2024 Primary and Election, a full 70% of ""conservative"" voters being in favor of states handling cannabis how they prefer, and even 52% saying they would be more likely to vote for a Republican Presidential nominee if they were openly in favor of legalization and supported state rights in handling the issue. I am quoting CPEAR polling via Forbes from February but you can find numerous polls conducted in the past 36 months on these issues and all indicators show Republicans have finally come around to cannabis reform and more are coming around to it every single day.

Beyond that, multiple Republican Senators have said (**in the past 2 weeks**) that the revised SAFER has the votes to pass committee *and* the full chamber. That isn't to say it definitely will pass, or that it will happen next week, but cannabis has obviously become a bipartisan issue in the last 2-3 years. A lot of anti-cannabis people **on both sides** have changed their minds because, well, they realized they were stupid and believed a bunch of lies that rich assholes told them to believe. Ok fine, some of them are being super cynical because they see how much money is involved, but that's just America. Change is change. One thing at a time, and if we can make progress on cannabis that way, who's to say real change on other issues isn't possible soon as well? 

I mean, rich assholes lying about reality is why we are where we are, and change has to start somewhere. I'd argue, forcefully, that change has already begun and that cannabis is simply getting swept up in the rising tide of change.

tldr: **Invest in United States based cannabis companies** if you believe in American values, polls, cynical congressional behavior, and capitalism. **Short United States based cannabis companies** if you believe in Trumpism, think society is on the brink of collapse, and believe positive change is impossible.

edit: But he is right about one thing: There's no way Biden is running on this issue. I can't see it becoming important enough for him to even take a clear stance on it. He's well known in Washington as an extremely savvy, cynical, career politician, and that's why his stance has changed from anti-drug to pro-legalization on cannabis. He's a politician; a product of our political system. He sees exactly which way popular opinion has turned, so he's turning with it. That is **literally** America. But he'll make sure to get progress on it without saying much about it himself. That's his way. It's the smart money way for an American politician, and one thing Joe Biden exemplifies is 'smart money politician'.",2,second,$MSOS - USA Cannabis play Price Target = $30 EOY 2023.
