      "Well, it is exactly what it sounds like. It's a shoebox, or at least once was, and whenever I masturbate I cum into it. I've had it for two or three years now I think, so it has a fair amount of cum. It smells atrocious, and I tried to burn it once. When I lit it on fire, it was too damp due to the cum that it simply sizzled and didn't manage to actually lite up. Turns out burning cum smells awful, so I had to spray it with a deodorant body spray just to get the old smell of burnt cum away. It also has some drenched papers stuck to it. That's pretty much it.\n",

      "EDIT 2: A lot of people are asking me, why? Well, I'm apparently a rather disturbed individual. But, it just kind of happened, bought new shoes and needed someplace to cum, used the box. It just escalated from there, kept using it each time, telling myself I would throw it out soon. Never did, two or three years later, I still have it. It was planned or anything, it just happened.\n",

      "Edit 4: I often get PMed about updates or current status of the box, generally a few a week. So I might as well update this post, if anyone even gets linked here anymore. Current status, I have created life. Mold has begun to grow in the box and has taken over a fair amount. Smells a bit worse, mainly due to a damper apartment so it does not dry as fast, hence the reason why the mold has begun. [New picture.](http://imgur.com/Gs5ur) \n",

On the day his wife died in a random accident he was bullied by mobsters into committing a crime, fell into a vat of chemicals and ended up alone, in pain, and scarred for life. The overall pain was such that he snapped.... realized that the world is cruel, unjust and random and decided he was going to destroy all fabric of the attempted, false, self-delusional order of the world and break everyone down to his level. He believes morals, ethics, are hypocritical nonsense. You can refer to the Dark Knight movie, in which he says \"I'm just ahead of the curve.\"  He spends the entire movie putting everyone in front of him in situations where, to survive, they will have to break their moral code.\n",

      "- So some time goes by and people start catching onto this system of credit-worthiness, and farmers and fishermen and so on start to realize that they can get better value for their IOUs by demonstrating credibility. People with shakier reputations or dubious prospects may not be able to \"issue money\", or might only be able to do so at very high \"interest\". E.g., a new farmer with no track-record might have to promise me twice as many potatoes in exchange for a deer haunch, due to the risk that I might never see any potatoes at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "- This obviously gets very messy fast, as different apple- and potato-certificates have different values depending on whether they were issued by Bob or Jane, and everyone has to keep track of and evaluate whose future apples are worth what. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Some enterprising person, maybe the merchant who runs the trading-post, comes up with the idea to just issue one note for all the farms in town. He calls a meeting with all the farmers, and proposes to have the town priest keep a book of certificates and so on, and the farmers will get notes just like everyone else in exchange for the crops they contribute to the pool, and the merchant will keep a cut of the crops with which to hire some accountants and farm-surveyors to estimate the total crop yields across town and so on. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Everyone agrees (or at least, enough farmers agree to kind of force the other ones to get on-board if they want to participate meaningfully in the town economy), and we now have something like a central bank issuing something like **fiat currency**: that is, currency whose value is \"decided\" by some central authority, as opposed to the kind of straight-up exchange certificates that can be traded for an actual apple from the issuer, for example.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Now we have something that looks a lot like a modern monetary system. The town can set up audit committees or whatever, but the idea is that there is some central authority basically tasked with issuing money, and regulating the supply of that money according to the estimated size of ongoing and future economic activity (future crop yields). \n",
      "\n",
      "- If they issue too much money, we get inflation, where more apple-certificates are issued than apples grown, and each apple-note ends up being worth only three-quarters of an apple come harvest-time. If they issue too little currency, economic activity is needlessly restricted: the farmers are not able to hire enough workers to maximize crop yields and so on, the hunter starts hunting less because his deer meat is going bad since nobody has money to buy it, and so on. \n",

      "\n",
      "The answer is because this is a *vastly* more efficient system than pure barter. I, as a hunter, no longer need to trade a physical deer haunch for a bushel of apples to carry over to the shoemaker in order to get shoes. You, as an apple-farmer, can hire workers *before* the crop is harvested, and therefore can grow more, and your workers can eat year-round instead of just getting a huge pile of apples at harvest-time to try and trade for for whatever they will need for the rest of the year. \n",

If the teacher was nicer, or more patient, maybe you would have understood better. If your father was better with money, maybe you'd have more opportunities.

It is rare, portable, easy to identify, can easily be made into jewelry, and can be easily quantified (unlike, say, jewels or seashells, which are harder to treat as a \"substance\"). Once word got around that rich people like it, it became easy to barter with anyone, anywhere, for anything. \n",

      "\n",
      "The early history of paper money did not evolve the way I described in the earlier posts (although it could have, and would have got to the same place). Instead, the early history of paper money was certificates issued by storage-vaults of precious metals (i.e., early \"banks\").

It takes 3 hours to get to and from work on the city bus which would only take 15 minutes with a car. So I wake up at 7am to get ready for work and to catch the 8am bus. Get to work at 10am work until 7 or later get home between 9pm and midnight depending on when I got off from work. There's literally no time to have another job. Barely enough time to clean the house and eat a properly cooked meal. \n",

That pay barely covers my living expenses. I'm making $150- $200 a week and I need new shoes. So I can buy $60 shoes that will last or $15 walmart shoes. So I buy the walmart shoes and some groceries instead of just the $60 shoes and no groceries. Three months later I'll need new shoes again. But I'll also have to pay rent and my light bill is due. So I'll pay the light bill and buy some \"shoe glue\" for $4 to fix my shoes for another few weeks until I can buy the $15 ones again.\n",

But* if I had a car* I might be able to pull it off. But based on my circumstances if I did have a car it would be a shitty one and either break down all the time or be a gas hog. So now I'm (theoretically) working that 2nd job of 20 hours a week just to pay for the car to take me to my 1st job. So now I'm getting to work faster. I'm working a 2nd job but my shitty car is costing me money and I'm actually making less money now then when I was riding the bus.  \n",

The US was built around the idea of the automobile. Also It's not ideal to show up to work after an (11 mile trip to work for me back then) bike ride sweaty, tired and needing a shower. Also I lived in the midwest so it would be 85-100 degrees in the summer with 80%+ humidity. Then there's the 6 months of winter with it's snow and ice. Also when your job is manual labor you don't really want to ride a bike 22 miles a day to get to work, nor is it acceptable to show up to work sweaty and dirty, no job wants that really. I would have been in amazing shape back then but I would also be spending a lot more on food to make up for the calories lost on the marathon on a bike every day. \n",

One hovered over top its fallen comrade for some time, and then landed on top it. It used its mandibles to prod the body, and then crawled around the dead wasp. Then, it flew up, and off it went. Almost aimlessly. The next time I encountered a number of wasps, I decided to kill another, only this time I left my weapon choice near the scene. I crushed the wasp slightly, so that it would not die immediately, and then placed the cigarette box near the body on the sill. When a second wasp came to inspect, it performed a routine similar that of the first wasp's. When it took off, it zeroed in on the cigarette pack almost immediately. It buzzed around the box for sometime, and then flew away. It was fascinating.\n",

It then used its mandibles to pick the spider up, and flew off with it. This also fascinated me. As much as I hated these wasps, observing there behaviours in different scenarios was quite interesting.\n",

      "I watched wasp was on the large window looking out onto the street. In the top corner. I observed it gently stroke its antennae with methodical precision, over and over with its forelegs. It was actually kind of beautiful, the way the light reflected off its eyes. A prism of light. Dark as the ocean blue, bright as the white hot sun, and as lively as ochre foliage dancing in the wind. I decided not to kill that wasp, I captured it instead. I placed it in the freezer, and dubbed it Lazarus when released from its cryogenic prison. But Lazarus did not awaken. Lazarus still sleeps within a glass house lying on my sill.\n",

      "OK. You know those old Electrolux, rolling vacuum cleaners? I discovered that by laying on top with a pillow underneath and sticking my dick just barely in the hole, the vacuum would both suck and vibrate my dick. I wasn't full grown at the time so it still fit. Actually, my relationship with Electro may have contributed to my present size. Anyway, you can imagine this was a pretty loud thing to do. So I was alone in the house one afternoon and no one was supposed to be home for a couple hours and I figured I'd put on a porno (VCR at the time) and have my way with Electro. Midway, the den door opens and there stands my Mom, little brother, little sister, and my best friends little sister, all staring at me with expressions ranging from horror (Mom) to amusement (sister and friend) to interest (brother). I jumped up with a raging hard-on and ran through the other door and down to my room, leaving the porno running. I don't remember the scene but it was the super dirty one that was always at the end of the tapes those days. My room had a door to the outside so I put on some clothes and bailed. My step dad tracked me down a few hours later and tried to make me feel better by telling me a story of how he got caught when he was a kid. That just added to the awkward. Eventually I made it home and from everyone's expression I could tell that they had been lectured to never mention it again. That didn't happen but luckily, we all went to different schools and no one could believe such a crazy story. At family dinners though, when awkward experiences comes up, you know who's story is the topper? Not mine. My family is fucking nuts.\n",

      "I had the fortune of living next to a bright guy, R. R. was an advanced student, to say the least. He was a sophomore, but was already taking the most advanced graduate math classes. He came into MIT and tested out of calculus, multivariable calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, real analysis (notoriously the most difficult math class at MIT), and a slew of other math courses. And to top it all off, he was attractive, engaging, sociable, and generally had no faults that would make him mortal.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suffered through half a semester of differential equations before my pride let me go to R. for help. And sure enough, he took my textbook for a night to review the material (he couldn't remember it all from third grade), and then he walked me through my difficulties and coached me. I ended up pulling a B+ at the end of a semester and avoiding that train wreck. The thing is, nothing he taught me involved raw brainpower. The more I learned the more I realized that the bulk of his intelligence and his performance just came from study and practice, and that the had amassed a large artillery of intellectual and mathematical tools that he had learned and trained to call upon. He showed me some of those tools, but what I really ended up learning was how to go about finding, building, and refining my own set of cognitive tools. I admired R., and I looked up to him, and while I doubt I will ever compete with his genius, I recognize that it's because of a relative lack of my conviction and an excess of his, not some accident of genetics.\n",

      "It's easy to trick ourselves into thinking that \"being smart\" is what determines our performance. In so many ways, it's the easiest possible explanation because it demands so little of us and immediately explains away our failings. You are facing this tension without recognizing it. You are blaming your intelligence in the first two paragraphs but you undermine yourself by saying you received good grades you didn't deserve. You recognize your lack of motivation as a factor in your lack of extracurricular activities but not in your SAT scores (fun fact: the variable that correlates most strongly to SAT performance is hours of studying for the SATs). Your very last statement could just as well apply to your entire post: \n",

You got a B probably because you were so used to understanding things that you didn't know how to deal with something that didn't come so easily. I'm guessing that early on you built the cognitive and intellectual tools to rapidly acquire and process new information, but that you've relied on those tools so much you never really developed a good set of tools for what to do when those failed. This is what happened to me, but I didn't figure it out until after I got crushed by my first semester of college. I need to ask you, has anyone ever taken the time to teach you how to study? And separately, have you learned how to study on your own in the absence of a teacher or curriculum? These are the most valuable tools you can acquire because they are the tools you will use to develop more powerful and more insightful tools. It only snowballs from there until you become like R. \n",

      "MIT has an almost 97% graduation rate. That means that most of the people who get in, get through. Do you know what separates the 3% that didn't from the rest that do? I do. I've seen it so many times, and it almost happened to me. Very few people get through four years of MIT with such piss-poor performance that they don't graduate. In fact, I can't think of a single one off the top of my head. People fail to graduate from MIT because they come in, encounter problems that are harder than anything they've had to do before, and not knowing how to look for help or how to go about wrestling those problems, burn out. The students that are successful look at that challenge, wrestle with feelings of inadequacy and stupidity, and begin to take steps hiking that mountain, knowing that bruised pride is a small price to pay for getting to see the view from the top. They ask for help, they acknowledge their inadequacies. They don't blame their lack of intelligence, they blame their lack of motivation. I was lucky that I had someone to show me how to look for that motivation, and I'm hoping that I can be that person for you in some small capacity over the Internet. I was able to recover from my freshman year and go on to be very successful in my studies, even serving as a TA for my fellow students. When I was a senior, I would sit down with the freshmen in my dorm and show them the same things that had been shown to me, and I would watch them struggle with the same feelings, and overcome them. By the time I graduated MIT, I had become the person I looked up to when I first got in.\n",

      "The OECD comparative price level for Australia is $136 USD. In the U.S the comparative price level is $100 (As it is the baseline comparison country for this measurement). This means that the cost of living, and prices for general goods, is only 1.36 times more in Australia than in the U.S. However to reiterate the minimum wage is 1.91 times greater. \n",
      "\n",
      "The OECD comparative price level for Denmark, the fifth most expensive country world, is a staggering $140 USD. Hence this means the cost of living in Denmark is 1.40 times greater than in the U.S. But the minimum wage in Denmark, as demonstrated by this TIL, is a whopping 2.89 times greater than in the U.S. Additionally the same website demonstrates Denmark having a grocery price index of 88.59 and the U.S at 81.81; the Danish minimum wage McDonald's worker could afford almost 3 times as many groceries as a U.S minimum wage worker. \n",
      "\n",
      "So in reality the McDonalds workers of Denmark possess far more purchasing power than their counterparts in the U.S. Combined with their free healthcare, and cheap education; they're leaps and bounds ahead. \n",
      "\n",
      "But then what's the other argument against minimum wage? \"Minimum wage harms businesses and impairs growth\". [From the data of GDP growth between countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_real_GDP_growth_rate) the GDP growth in high minimum wage countries like Australia is 2.50%. Whilst in the U.S GDP growth was only 1.60%. However Denmark's GDP growth in the same period was only 0.10%. So perhaps minimum wage is not considerably accountable for a countries growth or collapse. \n",
      "\n",
      "So why are we in U.S still faced with a pauper's minimum wage? Well maybe it's because, as you said, the facts are hushed and all the data has been cherry picked. \n",

      "**Edit 1: Denmark has no 'official' minimum wage**: After research it seems that Denmark does not have an official minimum wage. The higher wages are a result of union bargaining. Which occurs across the industries in Denmark. Thank you to /u/RunePoul. Sorry for the mistake. \n",

[This source shows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_Australia) that a minimum wage worker in Australia would take home $27,760 USD after tax. [And this source shows (thankyou to /u/torbeindallas)](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2t4hnl/til_that_all_mcdonalds_employees_over_18_in/cnw4txn) that the Danish McDonald's worker would take home $26,776 after tax. \n",
      "The Australian and Dane will take home 2.08 and 2.01 times more salary than the U.S minimum wage worker after tax. The increase is still greater than the increase in cost of living between these countries. However tax money in Australia and Denmark goes toward subsidised tertiary education, free healthcare, subsidised pharmaceuticals, and welfare (money for the unemployed/disabled/retired). So that should theoretically further increase the income of Australians and Danes, if isolated and factored out. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Edit 6: \"CPI is not an appropriate measurement to compare cost of living\"**: Regarding user complaints that I used the CPI index instead of a more appropriate PPP based comparison. I have changed the CPI comparisons with the OECD sourced \"comparative price levels\" data. This is naturally more reliable. After doing so the comparisons in cost of living between Australia and Denmark and the U.S changed only slightly; by about 0.1 times. So the comparisons still stand. Apologies. \n",

As a result I have no sense of communal responsibility, I don't get easily offended, and don't consider if I even belong to any sort of collective identity.  Because of this I also don't get how people can take their culture and ethnicity so seriously.  Lastly as a white male, people who aren't white males see me as privileged.  Due to this I don't speak on social or racial issues in public, as people tend to discount my perspective because *privilege*.  I also avoid people of other races, because I'm very socially awkward and am prone to offending people with faux pas and such and so long as I only offend other white people I'm simply an asshole rather than a racist.  Also I am very concerned I'll get skin cancer sometime in my life.\n",

      "I know reddit loves to be faux-controversial and take down idols from their supremely enlightened positions, but outright calling Lennon a wife beater is getting to be this sort of hive-mind circlejerk that makes me a little sad. If you do the research, he was a guy with a hard childhood, treated women like men treated women in those times, which was a good bit chauvinist, but his forthright first wife, Cynthia, who is still alive, and has written a book entitled John, who was with John from '58-'68, says that literally only one time he smacked her and her head hit a pipe. He was profusely sorry, mortified, and never did it again. He spent the rest of his life trying to be a more open, gentle, loving person. Not only did he never lay hand on Cynthia again, he never once laid hand on Yoko, '68-'80. Yes, he had a bad childhood and a lot of emotional insecurities from being a heartbroken child which cropped up in ways, like being a prick sometimes to try and mask his insecurities, but he worked through them and learned to be honest, open, and loving, and tried to use his fame to help better the world. People on reddit act as if they've never had a moment of bad behavior, or as if one cannot atone for a bad action and must wear it tattooed on their forehead, even if the wrongdoer has become seemingly absolved by working through and evolving past a former incarnation of themselves. He did these things when he was a troubled young man before twenty-one, and never again in his life because he truly learned to be a better person. Following below is a comment I have pasted from /u/lord_mayor_of_reddit , who describes with detail this meme of Lennon as a wife beater on reddit:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, it's a meme that's gone too far. [Here is a link](https://soundcloud.com/mayor_of_awesometown/john-cynthia-lennons-college-fight)  I prepared a while ago with sound clips. Essentially, the rumor stems from an interview John gave a couple months before he died. When commenting on the song Getting Better, he mentioned that he was \"a hitter. I fought men, I hit women.\" However, his wife Cynthia says he only ever hit her once, when he was around 17 and years before they were married. It caused them to break up for many months and he never did it again. Not that that's acceptable, just that \"wife beater\" isn't an accurate description. His only other LTRs in his life were with Yoko and with May Pang, both of whom have said he never hit them. However, he did have a bad temper and he was a mean drunk. At Paul's 21st birthday party, he beat the shit out of Bob Wooler, sending him to the hospital. It was a wake up call and, coupled with his preference for weed over booze starting in 1964, it was the last instance of his violence, bar some rumored altercations with out-of-line paparazzi. Mean drunk who would get in fistfights before the age of 21? Yes. Verbally abusive his entire life? Sometimes, and it mellowed over the years. Wife beater? No.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for walking out on his family, he certainly wasn't an ideal father to Julian, but Julian and his mother Cynthia defend John to this day. John was looking for happiness like anyone. I'm tired and don't care to assemble more on this subject. If somebody else would like to step in, that would be nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "edit: Wow, gold. Whoever did that, thank you. Also, I just fixed the broken audio link. It gets to be a bit much on reddit, some of the false information or inflated opinions that people pass along without digging deeper for the complex truth, and so, instead, you get these extremely facile memes, e.g., Lennon is a wife beater. Lennon was always open about his past, so open it shocked people, because he wasn't going to hide the truth, and he wanted to provide an example for others to change, much in the way he actually did. He was a good example of somebody who questioned poor mores and conventions of his time and actively tried to live to a better standard. I consider him a flawed person who was an incredible example for other flawed people to try and become better, more loving, gentle, open human beings.\n",
      "\n",
      "edit 2: I hope I have not appeared rationalizing about Lennon's behavior, but rather, contextualizing, playing a bit of devil's advocate. As I said in a few other comments, Lennon was an absolutely flawed person who did some awful, hateful things, but I think his life story is a bit more about maturation and development than I ever see given credit when his name comes up. He was no saint, and he was no devil. I think, personally, he was somewhere in the middle, trying his best merely to feed the good, the potential saintliness in himself and in humanity instead of the negative emotions associated with instinct and ego. If I have been too accrediting or biased (as a physically and emotionally abused child with a drunk father and absentee mother, who is also a Beatles fan), I am here to read your comments and take part in an active discussion about Lennon.\n",
