19,16pcprd,$MSOS - USA Cannabis play Price Target = $30 EOY 2023. I think Joe Biden will run on Full Recreational Legalization of Cannabis in 2024. üöÄ,464,0.83,"**BACKGROUND** **üåøüî• üòé**

**TL;DR** = The USA Cannabis space is a **GENERATIONAL BUYING OPPORTUNIY** near all time low stock prices. Yes we had a +60%, but this was off the all time low bottom.

This is a massive ""ABRITRAIGE"" opportunity for retail as Big Money (hedge funds, institutions and other big players) cannot buy USA Cannabis stocks as it's still ""Schedule 1"" which is soon to be reclassified to ""Schedule 3"".

Buying USA Cannabis stocks today is like getting in PRE-IPO after most stocks crashed -90% because the Federal Government hasn't done anything - **BUT THEY ARE NOW!**

**INVESTMENT THESIS = Biden will run on FULL Cannabis legalization in 2024** **ü§´**

Joe Biden will run on **FULL FEDERAL CANNABIS RECREATIONAL** legalization if you vote for him in the Nov 2024 elections!!!! This will be announced shortly after he reclassifies Cannabis to from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3 medical before the end of the year.

This is the Canada **Justin Trudeau ""PLAYBOOK""** where in 2015 Liberal Canadian party was in last place (3/3), then he promised Cannabis legalization and **FUCKING WON THE ELECTION!!!** üí£ üí•

Why does Joe Biden need this as a win? Because he DESPERATLY needs the youth vote who he is failing on Student Loans and Inflation. Also the tax revenues will help pay down the USA national debt.

**CATALYST FOR CANNABIS STONKS TO RE-RATE HIGHER**   üìà üíµ

**1)** **DEA 90-Day Schedule 3 ""Interim Ruling""** which will immediately become law and in Q1 2024 companies will be massively cash flow positive with the removal of tax 280e. **Kim Rivers CEO of Trulieve $TCNNF (who is a Lawyer herself) confirmed this on Twitter Spaces last month and who is already in talks with NASDAQ for uplisting when ready.** These USA Cannabis companies are paying an effective tax rate of \~70% right now and they can't write-off normal business expenses. This would allow up-listing to NYSE / NASDAQ.

**DATE** = November 27th, 2023 or before

**2a)** **SAFE Banking Act** in the Senate which will allow financial services to work with Cannabis companies to get business loans and allow up-lisintg to NYSE / NASDAQ.

**DATE** = Wednesnday, September 27th for the committee vote / Mark-up and then full ""Floor-Vote"" shortly after

**2b)** **""Garland Memo""** to replace the former rescinded ""Cole Memo"" which gave guidance to Financial institutions and USA Cannabis companies could up-list to NYSE / NASDAQ on this alone.

**DATE** = Anytime, although some people think it would be introduced along side of SAFE Banking Act. There were also rumours that it would be introduced on October 6th, 2023 which is the 1-Year anniversary since Joe Biden announced the rescheduling review last year.

**3)** **""Strategics"" entering the cannabis space** \- Big Tabaco, Big Alcohol, Big Pharma, Consumer Packaged Goods

Canopy has $STZ Constellation Brands, Cronos has $MO Altria, Organigram has $BTI British American Tabaco

CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods) companies are looking at the Cannabis sector too! In 2018 $KO (Coca-Cola) was in talks with $ACB (Aurora Cannabis). I would imagine that food players like **$PEP (PepsiCo)** and **$MDLZ (Mondelez)** with their snack portfolio is looking at a Cannabis partnership deal too! **The more ""HIGH"" you get, the HUNGIER you become and the more SNACKS you will eat!!!! BULLISH!!!** üêÉ

**DATE** = Anytime will happen out of nowhere and be massively bullish

**HOW TO BUY CANNABIS STONKS**  üî•

Because cannabis is still a schedule 1 narcotic, companies cannot be listed on the NYSE / NASDAQ and can only be bought OTC over the counter. As such, depending on your broker, you might only be able to buy $MSOS the USA Cannabis ETF.

There is also $MSOX which is the 2x ETF.

**January 2024 $20.00 strike calls** would be an interesting YOLO as it covers both:   üêã üí¶

**(1) SAFE Banking** and

**(2) DEA 90-Day ""Interim Ruling""** (Roughly Nov 27, 2023 or earlier) which becomes immediately law

When this happens, I think **stocks go 2x-3x easily**.

**TECHNICAL ANALYSIS**

$MSOS has a +600% gain to get back to all time highs. Also the volume is massive... you know the saying ""**VOLUME precedes price action**""  üçã

**EDIT:** I love how there is so much ""**disbelief**"" in the comment section.

This tells me that when Cannabis enters the **3rd ""bull market cycle"" (2013 California, 2018 Canada, and now 2023/2024 USA and GERMANY)**, some of you chase at the top +600% higher (as usual)  üòá
